This is different from a typical fine-tuning setup, as these embeddings, once generated are considered frozen, and won't be tuned along with rest of our models.

    "In batch negatives is widely used for training models with contrastive loss. Assuming there are $B$ positive pairs for a given mini batch, each of these positive pairs can be paired with $B - 1$ negatives (rest of the positive pairs within the same mini batch). This paradigm allows us to leverage the already loaded mini batch rather than using additional resources to sample negative examples. When relying on in batch negative sampling, using a larger batch size is key, as it allows the loss function to optimize over a more diverse set of negative samples. i.e. it's easier to find the right answer over a pool of 2 candidates, versus say 1024 candidates. This can be treated as an implicit version of hard negative mining.\n",

These model dependent methods are likely to perform better than performing lexical edits like insert/swap/delete/synonym replace [[4]](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug).

    "    - For images, there're plethora of image augmentation techniques, e.g. random cropping, resize, color distortion, gaussian blur, etc. All are methods to transform pixels while preserving the semantic meaning of an image's content such as its class labels. In un-supervised context such as SimCLR [[12]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709), where they rely on data augmentations to create positive pairs, they argue that stronger data augmentation is needed for contrastive learning to learn strong representations compared to the supervised counterparts, where the composite augmentation random cropping and color distortion was shown to stand out. \n",

    "With this strategy, we need to be mindful and ensure these examples are actually negatives. It is typically infeasible to scan through our entire dataset and label all the positive examples for a given anchor. Hence it can happen when sampling hard negatives, we might accidentally sample a positive example that wasn't labeled, introducing false negatives to the mix. To solve for this, we can train a separate cross-encoder model, which are typically more powerful at capturing semantic similarity compared to bi-encoder to denoise our hard negatives. In other words, when sampling hard negatives from the top ranked examples using aforementioned strategies, we can only select the ones that are predicted as negatives by the cross encoder with high confidence score.\n",

If we are lacking data for a particular domain of interest, one trend in informational retrieval is to leverage generative models to generate synthetic data for training ranking models. At its core, the idea is large generative models have demonstrated impressive results across the board on many NLP tasks, however, they can be expensive to apply at run time. Hence, instead of using them directly in our system, we would like to apply them in an offline setting, where we use them to generate more in-domain training data for training our actual retrieval or ranking model. This arguably can be seen as an alternative form of distillation, where we aim to distill the knowledge of large generative models into small bi-encoder or cross encoder models via prompt generation.

This filtering step, sometimes referred to as consistency check can be done via training a bi-encoder model (e.g. from MiniLM, Deberta v3, etc.) on the generated pairs, then for each query, we retrieve a set of documents, and mark a query as passing the consistency check if the top-k retrieved document was the document from which the query was generated.\n",
