    "Like the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model, **WARP** deals with (user, positive item, negative item) triplets. Unlike BPR, the negative items in the triplet are not chosen by random sampling: they are chosen from among those negative items which would violate the desired item ranking given the state of the model. This approximates a form of active learning where the model selects those triplets that it cannot currently rank correctly.\n",

    "This procedure yields roughly the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a given user, positive item pair, sample a negative item at random from all the remaining items. Compute predictions for both items; if the negative item's prediction exceeds that of the positive item plus a margin, perform a gradient update so we can rank the positive item higher and the negative item lower. If there is no rank violation, continue sampling negative items until a violation is found.\n",
    "- If we found a violating negative example at the first try, make a large gradient update: this indicates that a lot of negative items are ranked higher than positives items in current state of the model, and the model should be updated by a large amount. If it took a lot of sampling to find a violating example, perform a small update since the model is likely close to the optimum and should be updated at a low rate.\n",

To formalize this, during the sampling for negative items step, say we needed to sample $Q$ times before we were able to find such pairwise violation, then that means in our negative items pool, the probability of sampling a negative item whose score violates the pairwise comparison is:\n",
